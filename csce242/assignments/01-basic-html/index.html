        <p>Quokkas are a species of mammal that live in southwestern Australia. They live on the mainland, as well as on some smaller islands off of the coast of Australia. The quokkas inhabiting Rottnest Island, in paritucular, have become famous for their friendly nature towards humans. On this island, their only predators are snakes, giving the quokkas there a lack of fear surrounding most animals. This has led them to easily approach humans who visit the island.

        <p>Quokkas belong to a group of mammals known as marsupials. The most well-known characteristic of marsupials is that they carry their young in a pouch on their body as they develop. Marsupials are primarily found in Australia, which is home to a number of unique species including kangaroos, koalas, wombats, and more, alongside quokkas. Wombats in particular are often confused with quokkas because they have similar appearances, although they are significantly different sizes. The following information provides similarities and differences between wombats and quokkas</p>
