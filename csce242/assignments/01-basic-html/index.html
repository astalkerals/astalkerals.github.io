        <p>Quokkas are a marsupial species that live in southwestern Australia. They live on the mainland, as well as sime smaller islands off of the coast of Australia. The quokkas inhabiting Rottnest Island, in paritucular, have become famous for their friendly nature towards humans. On this island, their only predators are snakes, giving the quokkas there a lack of fear surrounding most animals. This has led them to easily approach humans who visit the island.
